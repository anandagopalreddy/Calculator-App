# Calculator-App
This project is a console-based Calculator application built using core Data Structures such as ArrayList, Queue, and LinkedList to perform and manage arithmetic operations efficiently. It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while demonstrating the internal use of these data structures to store and evaluate expressions dynamically.

ArrayList is used to store a history of calculations, enabling retrieval and review of previous results.

Queue is used to manage input tokens in a First-In-First-Out manner, which is helpful for parsing infix or postfix expressions during evaluation.

LinkedList is employed for dynamic and memory-efficient expression traversal or intermediate result tracking, especially useful for recursive or chained operations.

This calculator not only performs accurate calculations but also serves as a practical demonstration of how different data structures can be applied in real-world programming tasks like expression evaluation, state tracking, and memory-efficient data handling.

It is ideal for students or developers learning data structures and algorithms with Java or Python and wanting to apply them in hands-on projects.
